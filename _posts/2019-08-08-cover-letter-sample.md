I'm writing this post to share my cover letter, which I'm using for my internship applications. Cover letter is useful to supplement the resume and the key information that it contains is the reason of why your skills match the job position. How have you developed your skills. What past experiences and contributions will make you an ideal candidate for a given position. This post covers an example of a Ph.D. student applying for an Internship application in Data Science at some company.
