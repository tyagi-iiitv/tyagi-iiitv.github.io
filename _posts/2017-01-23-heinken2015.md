### Introduction

This posts presents the summary of the paper by **Almut Heinken** and **Ines Thiele** published in 2015. You can also view the pdf of the  full paper [Heinken2015Anoxic](https://aem.asm.org/content/aem/81/12/4049.full.pdf). Comment on this post if you want the supplementary material for this paper.

Here we consider 11 representative gut microbes:

- B. thetaiotamicron VPI-5482
- F. prausnitzii A2-165
- L. plantarum WCFS1
- L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363
- S. thermophilus LMG18311
- H. pylori 26695
- K. pneumoniae MGH 78578
- S. enterica subsp. typhimurium LT2
- E. coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655
- E. coli O157:H7 str. Sakai
- E.coli O157:H7 str. EDL933

The motive is to study the community behavior of these microbes pairwise and study whether their behavior lies in any of the following categories shown below:

### Details
Four types of conditions that can appear inside the human gut are considered for the community behavior analysis of the microbes. These are:

1. **No Oxyger and without gut enterocytes interaction**: This situation occurs in the large intestine proximity at the center of the lumen. 
2. **No Oxygen and with gut enterocytes**: This situation arises when the microbes get exposed to sloughed epithileal cells but still there is no oxygen because the microbes are far from the epithelial cell layer. 
3. **With Oxygen and without gut enterocytes**: This situation occurs at the mid point of the lumen in the duodenum where some oxygen swallowed with the food is present. This is in proximity of the stomach.
4. **With Oxygen and with gut enterocytes**: When the microbes are close to the epithelial layer with oxygen dissipated by the enterocyte. 

- The below diagram represents all of the above mentioned cases.

### Methods applied for simulations

- Host and microbes were joined through a separate compartment (u) sim-
ulating the intestinal lumen. This compartment served as an inlet for
nutrients derived from the simulated diet and the enterocyte; it allowed
metabolite exchange between the microbes and provided an outlet for
fermentation end products. 
- First the single models and then the community models were simulated in the above mentioned environments.
- Each of these models were analyzed for three types of diets: **Proteins, High fiber and Western.**
- The Western diet was high in sugar and fat content but low in fiber content.
- The High fiber diet was high in fiber content but low in simple sugar and fat content.
- The protein diet had twice the protein content compared to other diets and had low fat content with moderate simple sugar and fiber content.

### Results
The following graphs show the results obtained for each type of behavior based on 12 scenarios i.e. all the combinations of **(three diets + With/Without Enterocytes + With/Without Oxygen).**

- Total outcomes predicted for 55 microbe pairs subjected to 12 scenarios.

- Microbe behavior when paired in all combinations in 12 scenarios for simulataneous growth optimizations.

- Microbe-microbe co-culture outcomes, resolved by diet, oxygen status and enterocyte presence/absence.
