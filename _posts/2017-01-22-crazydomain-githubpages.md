### Prerequisites
The following prerequisites are important as they filter the target audience for this article. However, you can still go through this article if you wish to understand how to link your github pages site to any custom url.

- A [Crazy Domains](crazydomains.com) url.
- A [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)  website.

### Step 1: Add a cname file
- Create a "**CNAME**" file in the root directory of your github website. For this go to the root directory of your github site and click on "**Create new file**" option on the top of the page. Then type the file name as **CNAME** and type your url name as the content. Note that you don't need to use http:// of www. See the sample [on my github pages site.](https://github.com/tyagi-iiitv/tyagi-iiitv.github.io) for my website. My CNAME file contains **codemyway.in** without any spaces or any extra text. 
- Commit the changes and you're done with STEP 1.

### Step 2: Link your site
- Log in to your crazy domains account and click on **Domains** under the My Account section.

  ![Click on Domains]({{ site.BASE_PATH }}/images/front_page_crazydomains.png  "Click on Domains")
- Scroll down to the **DNS Settings** section and Click on **Add Record**
 
  ![Click on Add record]({{ site.BASE_PATH }}/images/a_record_window.png  "Click on Add record")
 
 - You've to add 3 records as shown in the image below. Replace **codemyway.in** with your url and don't change any other records. Add two **A records** pointing to the github pages server **192.30.252.153** and **192.30.252.154**. Then add a **CNAME** record as "www.your_url" which gets linked to ** yourusername.github.io ** which is the default url generated by github pages site. In case of project sites, the CNAME record should point to **your_project_repo.github.io**. 

   ![Add these records]({{ site.BASE_PATH }}/images/adding_records.png  "Add these records")
